# An Introduction to Shaders in Unity3D

Answers questions like:

- What are shaders and what are they used for?
- What different types of shaders are there?
- How are shaders written and used in Unity3D?

This repo includes slides and a Unity3D 5 project, containing the two shaders,
written during the talk and a third one, inspired by the shader used in
[Rototo](http://playroto.to).
